# Full Stack Development Bootcamp Curriculum

This repository contains the complete curriculum for a hands-on, project-based full-stack development bootcamp. The curriculum is designed to be completed independently, guiding you through building, securing, and deploying a modern web application from scratch.

## 🚀 How to Use This Curriculum

This repository contains only the documentation and curriculum for the bootcamp. You will build the application code yourself by following the daily exercises.

### Step 1: Get Your Own Copy

It is essential that you **do not** work directly in this repository. Instead, you should create your own copy on GitHub:

1.  **Fork this repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page to create a personal copy under your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone your fork:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine. Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-bootcamp.git
    cd fullstack-bootcamp
    ```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

Follow the instructions in [`docs/day_0_environment_setup.md`](./docs/day_0_environment_setup.md) to prepare your development environment. This is a critical step that ensures you have all the necessary tools installed and configured.

### Step 3: Start Building!

Begin with [`docs/day_1_git_setup.md`](./docs/day_1_git_setup.md) and proceed through the daily lessons. Each document contains a set of deliverables, success criteria, and hints to guide you. The goal is not to copy-paste code, but to learn by doing.
